#SharePoint-Master

SharePoint Online minimal master page. Provides a solid starting point for any branding work.

## Why?

Because starting a branding project using Oslo.master or Seattle.master is unnecessarily complex and results in bloated code. Minimal.master doesn't work that well either.

## Features

* Unstyled
* Minimal
* Responsive
* Mobile-first
