#SharePoint-Master

SharePoint Online minimal master page. Provides a solid starting point for any branding work.

## What is it?

It's the bare minimum master page to start your own branding project for SharePoint Online. Don't expect it to look pretty without some development love.

## Why?

Because starting a branding project using existing master pages is unnecessarily complex and results in bloated code. Don't get me started on Design Manager.

You could use some other SharePoint master page templates, but even those come with a bunch of jank such as unnecessary classes on elements.

If you like starting from a blank canvas, this master page is for you.
