#SharePoint-Master

SharePoint Online minimal master page. Provides a solid starting point for any branding work.

## Why?

Because starting a branding project using Oslo.master or Seattle.master is unnecessarily complex and results in bloated code. Minimal.master doesn't work that well either.

You could use some other SharePoint master page templates, but even those come with a bunch of jank such as unnecessary classes on elements.
